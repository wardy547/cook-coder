My name is Ryan Ward, I am currently a kitchen manager from Hampshire, UK. And this is my journey from cook to coder. At the time of writing this I have been working in kitchens for nearly 4 years. I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up, but at the ripe old age of 24, now I finally do. I donâ€™t know what I want to do in the tech industry yet but I know it has something to do with computers and the internet. 

### More Information

This is going to be the platform I use to think aloud, talk to my readers and take sound advice from experienced members of the community. Please join me, share me and contact me. I am hoping to encourage people to start their own journey from a job that pays the bills to a job they love. i will be going back to college and university in september. So my posts will be based on the work i'm doing. Any research i have to do, or pieces i have to write. and i will convey them to you guys.
