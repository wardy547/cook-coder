My name is Ryan Ward, I am currently a kitchen manager and this is my journey from cook to coder. At the time of writing this I have been working in kitchens for nearly 4 years. I never knew what I wanted to do when I grew up, but at the ripe old age of 24, now I finally do. I donâ€™t know what I want to do in the tech industry yet but I know it has something to do with computers and the internet. 

### More Information

This is going to be the platform I use to think aloud, talk to my readers and take sound advice from experienced members of the community. Please join me, share me and contact me. I am hoping to encourage people to start their own journey from a job that pays the bills to a job they love.
